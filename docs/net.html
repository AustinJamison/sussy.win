                <h1>1.0 Network Concepts</h1>
                <p>First we have the OSI (Open Systems interconnection) model.
                It breaks down how we are able to transfer information across the internet.
                The layers are, 1 (Physical), 2 (Data link), 3 (Network), 4 (Transport), 5 (Session), 6 (Presentation), and 7 (Application).
                Before I explain what each layer includes make sure you understand this is just a model, it is not absolute.
                <br>
                Physical layer (1) is what transports the bits. Physical layer devices includes the obvious (cables/fiber/ethernet), but also wireless devices (bluetooth/wifi/nfc), 
                aswell as hubs and repeaters. Layer 1 is a repeater passing along what is received and deals with raw bits.
                <br>
                Data Link Layer (2) packages data into frames & transmits those from an network MAC (media access control).
                <br>
                Network Layer (3) routes data
