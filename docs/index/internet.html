            <p>so you want to visit your favorite website sussy.win. you open safari and click on my already bookmarked website, 
                getting you a sweet hit of dopamine. what in da hellyonta just happened? i will break this down more & more each phase.</p>
            <p class="b i">phase 1</p>
            <p>to send mail to someone you need there home address. likewise with the internet, but instead of a home address, we have a IP address. so your phone has a IP address and
            so does the computer that runs my website. aswell as everything that connects to the internet. they all have an IP.</p>
            
            <p>after entering sussy.win and pressing enter into your browser, it sends a request to the host (my computer) and asks for the webpage data. similar to that of a return address on mail, 
                the request you just made contains your IP address. my computer then sends back the webpage data you requested to that return IP address allowing you to load the webpage sussy.win. 
                this all happens within milliseconds.</p>
            <p>in reality you aren't connecting to my computer to access this website. its instead hosted by github pages on there servers. now even though i said server, its just another computer. 
                this computer just has a dedicated task of hosting my website, which is why its referred to as a server (it servers you), like a waiter at a resturant.</p>
            
            <p>talking about servers, you actually are visiting another server before mine. its called the DNS (domain name system) server. sussy.win isn't a IP address, so we use DNS to translate the domain into the IP that corresponds to the server
            the domain owner has setup. the DNS server is run by ICANN, a non-profit, public-benefit corporation that makes sure the internet functions correctly.</p>
            
            <p><span class='b'>review:</span><br>so everything on internet needs an IP address.<br>servers are just computer with a dedicated service.<br>DNS (domain name system) translates domain names (sussy.win) into IP address (192.168.0.1).</p>
