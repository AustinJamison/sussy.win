            <p><span class="b">symmetric</span> and <span class="b">asymmetric</span> are 2 types of encryption. Caesar Cipher is an example of symmetric encryption, which means the same secret key (in this case "3") encrypts and decrypts the message.
                where as asymmetric encryption uses a "public key" to encrypt and a related "private key" to decrypt. the public key can be freely shared and publicly known all while not comprising the encryption. <span class="i">example of asymmetric encryption below:</span></p>
            <p><span class="b">PGP</span> (pretty good privacy) refers to programs using public key cryptography for <span class="b">data encryption</span> and <span class="b">digital signatures</span>. the start of PGP originated by a man named Philip R. Zimmermann in 1991. PGP was birthed as a software application as a way to encrypt files and email communications. the original program is in the grave, but numerous open-source and commercial implementations of the OpenPGP standard (revised from mr zimmermann's pgp model) are widely available.  </p>
            <p class="u">how it works</p>
            <p class="ml">couple things to remember is that the public key encrypts & private key decrypts. so you want to send a package to your friend that only he can open. how do you do it? first your friend needs to create a <span class="b">key pair</span>. that key pair will contain a "public" and "private"</p>
            <p class="u">what its used for</p>
            <p><span class="b i ml">encryption</span></p>
            <p><span class="b i ml">digital signatures</span> are used for authentication and integrity. you would then use your <span class="u">private key 2 encrypt</span>. thus since the "private key" is well private, it can be assumed only that person(s) has access to it. we now have <span class="b">non-repudiation</span> meaning the signer cannot deny having signed the message.</p>
