                <h4>TROUBLESHOOTING METHODOLOGY</h4>
                <p class="t">7 steps. identify the problem. establish a theory of probable cause. test the theory. establish a plan of action. implement the solution. verify full system functionality. document what was learned.</p>
                <p class="t">(1) identify the problem</p>
                <p class="a">6 key points in this step. gather information; gather as much information on the source of the problem from end users, logs and error messages. question users; the goal is to elicit as much useful information as possible and determine if the problem is isolated to a single user. identify symptoms; be able to identify actual symptoms or indicators of the problem by extracting information from user / device, ask about any strange behavior noticed before the problem and if any error messages were displayed. identify changes; determine if anything has changed prior to the current problem, like updates, installation of new applications. duplicate the problem; if you can duplicate the problem this will help you identify the triggering or contributing cause of problem, make sure to detail each step. approach multiple problem individually; approach each problem as a separate and individual issue rather than as a whole.</p>
                <p class="t">(2) establish a theory of probable cause</p>
                <p class="a">hypothesis for what is likely causing the problem. multiple sources can be used to establish this theory, including other network techs, vendor documentation, and online research. always question the obvious first, both physical and logical. physical examples include faulty wire, device not powered on / plugged in. logical causes can be incorrect password, passphrase, SSID, port, routing and IP conf problems,  firewall / ACL problems and certificate issues. consider multiple approaches, there are 3. top-to-bottom/bottom-to-top OSI model; using the layers of OSI model to methodically work through a problem. divide-and-conquer; uses the layers of the OSI model but is not limited to beginning at the top or bottom.</p>
                <p class="t">(3) test the theory</p>
                <p class="a">this will confirm your theory or rule out it as a potential cause of the problem. if not confirmed establish a new theory or escalate the problem.</p>
                <p class="t">(4) establish a plan of action</p>
                <p class="a">once establishing a plan to resolve the problem, test the plan to ensure it is effective and identify any potential effects the plan may have on the device and network.</p>
                <p class="t">(5) implement the solution</p>
                <p class="a">once plan of action established & tested with potential effects identified its time to implement.</p>
                <p class="t">(6) verify full system functionality</p>
                <p class="a">verify solution has no unintended consequences on the system and implement preventive measures to avoid recurrence of same problem.</p>
                <p class="t">(7) document what was learned</p>
                <p class="a">document all findings from entire process. such as; a description of problem and conditions that caused it, device details (OS, software versions, device model/type, network interface information), if/how problem was reproduced, theories and solutions tested, successful solution, lessens learned and how problem can be avoided in the future.</p>

                <p class="t">STP (spanning tree protocol)</p>
                <p class="a">layer 2. prevent network loops, which are when data packets continually flow through network due to multiple available paths to destination port. STP uses logical topology of network devices, identifying and removing redundant paths. STP gives roles to switches such as root port, designated port, non-designated port. root port; provides the best path to root bridge. root bridge is what STP assigns as the primary switch. the root bridge is used to designate paths to other devices in network eliminating loops. designated port; used for communications from network segment to root port. non-designated port; one that is blocked to prevent loops. port state in STP is the operational status of that port on that switch. 4 primary port states. blocking, listening, learning and forwarding. blocking; doesnt forward packets but monitors BDPUs (bridge protocol data units). listening; port actively exchanges BDPU packets but doesnt forward packets. learning; port learns MAC addresses but doesnt forward packets. forwarding; port actively forwards packets through network.</p>
