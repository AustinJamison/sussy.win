                <p class="a">transmits packets to host using mac address. doesn't cross boundary of local network. "frame" layer. receivers mac address obtained by placing ARP (address resolution protocol) request through the network (asking how has this [IP] ??) and destination host replies with its MAC. . devices used are switches and bridges.</p>
